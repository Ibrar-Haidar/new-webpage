- **Relation with other parts**: This part could be used for the quest section for instance if any player is stuck in any quest and they are not able to move forward they could use dream action where in its dream some old wizard will help them to solve the quest or atleast provide hint how to solve. Offering a help might not get any experience points for old wizard, but an older wizard might gain community reputation and connection, so their social status goes up and maybe that is another way of a more experienced wizard to strengthen their magical abilities in the wizard world.
- **Example**: Players might have dreams or visions of legendary wizards, mythical creatures that foreshadow their destiny or upcoming quests. These dreams serve as hints or clues to guide players on their journey and inspire them to pursue their goals.

To explain further, imagine cooking a meal, writing a letter, coming up with a marketing strategy, designing a wireframe, building a small shelve for books, etc... is possible a CRAFTING ...but: e.g. creating a laptop, building a house, making some sort of "iron man" suit is definitely not something one person alone can easily do alone.

### SUMMON
- **Not Covered**
- **Description**: In the wizard world, players also has an ability to summon change into it. This change necessarily does not have to be a big change it could be anything any small changes counts. It can include summoning a new creature, but it can involved changing the landscape, adding new game realms or dimensions ...or establishing a new FORGING option.
- **Realtion with other parts**: The main difference between summon and forge is that in forging we could forge stuff that is already known e.g. "forging a flying wizard zepplin" if such a thing is already known, then "SUMMONING" is creating small or even new epic adventures. It involves creating a lot of QUESTS for others to join to help in research or collection of magical resources or experimenting combining different forged wizard machineries to unlock entirely new "supply chains" to conjour new magical "goods/services". 
- **Example**: It summons something new out of nothing like "Flying dragon" if not already summoned and needs a lot of mighty wizards with a vision of what to summon and it requires to channel a lot of mana as well.
