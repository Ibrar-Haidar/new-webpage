Player requires the right kind of gear/equipment and skills to perform such action.
- **Relation with other part**: This is similar to the craft part the only main difference is it creating physical items whereas crafting is more creating virtual digital items. Player does not require special equipment to start crafting, other than studying and some basic ingredients widely available. While Forging requires special equipment and for most part it is only possible collaboratively with the help of other wizards or help of old/senior wizards with a lot of experience, gears and equipments. To explain further, imagine cooking a meal, writing a letter, coming up with a marketing strategy, designing a wireframe, building a small shelve for books, etc... is possible a CRAFTING ...but: e.g. creating a laptop, building a house, making some sort of "iron man" suit is definitely not something one person alone can easily do alone. It requires serious equipment, skills and collaboration among wizards.
