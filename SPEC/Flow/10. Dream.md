### DREAM
- **Not Covered**
- **Description**: Dreaming or [envisioning future goals<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352378603/) and aspirations could be integrated into the game's narrative or [character development<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352236280/) process.
- **Relation with other parts**: This part could be used for the quest section for instance if any player is stuck in any quest and they are not able to move forward they could use dream action where in its dream some old wizard will help them to solve the quest or atleast provide hint how to solve. Offering a help might not get any experience points for old wizard, but an older wizard might gain community reputation and connection, so their social status goes up and maybe that is another way of a more experienced wizard to strengthen their magical abilities in the wizard world.
- **Example**: Players might have dreams or visions of legendary wizards, mythical creatures that foreshadow their destiny or upcoming quests. These dreams serve as hints or clues to guide players on their journey and inspire them to pursue their goals.
