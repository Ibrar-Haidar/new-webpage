- **Description**: The magical book serves as a repository of knowledge and spells for wizards. It contains ancient spells or charms, secret symbols, and magical formulas that can be used to cast spells and perform various magical actions.
- **Functionality**: Wizards can use the magical book to learn new spells, study magical theory, and record their own magical experiments and discoveries.
- **Acquisition**: The magical book can be acquired from magical libraries, obtained as a quest reward, or purchased from wizard gear stalls (There could be single magical book or we could make different magical book naming it different like if they want to learn they could get ancient one or if they want to record there own journal they could have different one).
- **Usage**: Players can access the magical book through their inventory or by equipping it as a primary item or they could have it in their omni bag. They can flip through its pages to read spells, annotate pages with personal notes, or cast spells directly from the book during battles(if we have battles) or challenges..
