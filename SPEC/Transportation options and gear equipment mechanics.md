## Wizard Character Gameplay Elements

### Learning & Coding:
In the game, players will encounter magical challenges that require them to write spells using a [coding interface<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352233117/). For example, they might need to write a spell to create a [protective barrier<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333844/) around themselves or to conjure a [magical creature<sup>2a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232617/)/[magical creature<sup>2b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333838/)  to aid them in their quest.

Players can also [collaborate on coding projects<sup>3b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312309/) within the game. They might join forces with other players to create a magical library of spells, contribute to an open-source magical framework, or even establish a virtual company to develop magical applications for the [wizarding community<sup>4b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352327075/).
