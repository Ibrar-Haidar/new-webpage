##  Transportation options and gear/equipment mechanics

### Transportation and Portals:
Wizards have access to various modes of transportation, each with its unique characteristics and benefits:

1. **[Broomsticks<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312828/)**: broomsticks allow wizards to fly through the skies with agility and speed. Players can soar above the enchanted landscapes, discovering hidden secrets and navigating obstacles from above.

2. **[Magical Portals<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352235016/)**: These mystical gateways connect [different regions and dimensions<sup>2a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352236328/) within the magical realm. Players can use the [realm ring<sup>2b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/844493673168126/), a magical artifact, to open and configure [portals<sup>3b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352378616/) to desired locations. Once inside a portal, players can teleport to other realms or main world places, although some portals may require time to transition through.

3. **[Wizard Bubble<sup>4b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319784/)**: Wizards can conjure large magical bubbles that float above the ground, serving as mobile shelters and transportation vessels. Players can ride inside these bubbles, floating effortlessly across the landscape and exploring hard-to-reach places. The wizard bubble provides protection from environmental hazards and allows players to rest and recharge during their travels.

4. **[Walking<sup>5b</sup>]([https:/](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312892/)/)**: For shorter distances or when exploring confined spaces like magical forests or hidden caves, walking remains a reliable method of transportation. It allows players to immerse themselves fully in the magical world, discovering hidden treasures and interacting with NPCs along the way.

 - 1a. [Magical Portals](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352235016/): A portal that connects two different dimension (in our case connecting our different projects)<br />

 - 2a. [different regions and dimensions](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352236328/): might be not best representation but if we create portal in our one website we might need to create one in our other projects as well like there should be a portal in playproject.io as well so they could travel from there to wizard amigos as well.<br />
[<img width="25%" alt="inactive and active portal" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0c/e2/b2/0ce2b2cbcf8d98388f75b5f5be15094b.jpg">](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352236328/)

- 1b. [Broomsticks](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312828/): This could one form of transportation but if we are going toward more cyberpunk and futuristic style this will not match well.<br />
[<img width="25%" alt="witch on broomstick" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5f/a3/53/5fa353842a7b61cb8e322ba9783a2166.jpg">](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312828/)

- 2b. [realm ring](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/844493673168126/): we didn't had realm ring in our moodboards we might need to add some. (this was the random one I found in pinterest)<br />
[<img width="25%" alt="realm ring" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5f/05/69/5f0569aa2be65fa19894bb020ae0f0ce.jpg">](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/844493673168126/)

- 3b. [portals](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352378616/): Another representation of how portal might look like.<br />

- 4b. [Wizard Bubble](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319784/): Instead of broomstick we could go with this more modern style of bubble transportation.<br />
[<img width="25%" alt="wizard bubble" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4b/e0/d1/4be0d176a6751d7310eb0b3d2ceca81a.jpg">](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319784/)

- 5b. [Walking](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312892/): if we going with first person view walking might not be the best suitable means of transport.<br />

Players can visit the stall to pick up essential items for their journey or exchange items they no longer need.

This encourages players to make strategic decisions about which items to take on their quests and adventures.
