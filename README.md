## [Important Points](https://github.com/Ibrar-Haidar/new-webpage/blob/main/SPEC/important%20points.md)

* The wizard world should probably not use any floating islands.
* The wizard world is a magical strange world
* The wizards can use the realm ring and portals to enter the world of floating island in playproject, but thats a detail because there are many other worlds and we want to focus on the wizard world for now and the game
* The world needs to blend elements of the perspective of a "first person shooter" (so the player is in the camera) and has menus and buttons and inventories they can open but the wizard character also can be customized, so in that mode the player should see the wizard also in the "ego perspective" (player is the camera), with a little representation of the avatar with stats on the corner of the screen would be ideal.
* we always need news about the world.
* learning details about items/worlds/game features, is necessary also later in the game, so it shouldnt be just merged with character creation.
