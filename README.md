## Breaking down how each part contributes to the main categories of playing a wizard character in the game

### Learning & Coding:
In the game, players will encounter magical challenges that require them to write spells using a [coding interface<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352233117/). For example, they might need to write a spell to create a [protective barrier<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333844/) around themselves or to conjure a [magical creature<sup>2a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232617/)/[magical creature<sup>2b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333838/)  to aid them in their quest.

Players can also [collaborate on coding projects<sup>3b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312309/) within the game. They might join forces with other players to create a magical library of spells, contribute to an open-source magical framework, or even establish a virtual company to develop magical applications for the [wizarding community<sup>4b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352327075/).

 - 1a. [coding interface](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352233117/): Interface could look like this modern tab or window vr style. Or we could go with ancient [wood style](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232746/) or use [book](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232717/) as an interface.
 - 2a. [magical creature](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232617/): This magical creature could have there own unique power or an ability to help with quest.

- 1b. [protective barrier](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333844/): We can create some opposing thing for example if player fail in quest he might lose some health or xp. On activation of protective barrier it might help to slow down the health loss.
- 2b. [magical creature](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333838/): This is another way magical creature could be represented.
- 3b. [collaborate on coding projects](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312309/): We can create a virtual VR environment through which multiple players could connect and start working on single projects collaboratively. 
- 4b. [wizarding community](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352327075/): This type of discord style communication screen could be created so that user could communicate with eachother through it and it will increase interaction between players to keep them engage.


### Magical Nomadism:
As players explore different regions of the [magical realm<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312761/), they'll need to navigate various modes of transportation, such as [flying on broomsticks<sup>2b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319772/), teleporting through [magical portals<sup>3b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352318845/), or some kind of [bubble<sup>4b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319776/) mentioned earlier.

Players will encounter challenges related to finding suitable accommodation in [different environments<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232650/). For example, they might need to set up magical tents in the [enchanted forest<sup>5b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312784/), find shelter in [hidden caves<sup>6b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312371/) in the mountains, or seek refuge in [floating cities<sup>7b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352316312/) in the sky.

In terms of gear and equipment, players will acquire magical items that aid them in their nomadic lifestyle. These could include enchanted backpacks with limited storage space, multi-functional tools like the omni bag, or protective gear imbued with magical properties.

As mentioned we should skip flying rock we can ulter this one a little bit make it into hidden forest vibe (this idea came into my mind from documentatory on inhabitant of amazon rainforest).
- 2b. [flying on broomsticks](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319772/): This could one form of transportation but if we are going toward more cyberpunk and futuristic style this will not match well.

- 5b. [enchanted forest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312784/): we could use something similar to this big tree somewhere in our project.
- 6b. [hidden caves](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312371/): This might look more like big tunnel than cave but just to convey idea we could make it look like hidden cave somehow used as an accommodation.
- 7b. [floating cities](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352316312/): This was exactly what I meant from floating city(we can skip this one just for the reference what I meant by floating city).


### Healthy Lifestyle:
Throughout their adventures, players will come across opportunities to engage in activities that promote a [healthy lifestyle<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232614/).

##  transportation options and gear/equipment mechanics

### Transportation and Portals:
Wizards have access to various modes of transportation, each with its unique characteristics and benefits:

1. **[Broomsticks<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312828/)**: broomsticks allow wizards to fly through the skies with agility and speed. Players can soar above the enchanted landscapes, discovering hidden secrets and navigating obstacles from above.

2. **[Magical Portals<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352235016/)**: These mystical gateways connect [different regions and dimensions<sup>2a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352236328/) within the magical realm. Players can use the [realm ring<sup>2b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/844493673168126/), a magical artifact, to open and configure [portals<sup>3b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352378616/) to desired locations. Once inside a portal, players can teleport to other realms or main world places, although some portals may require time to transition through.

3. **[Wizard Bubble<sup>4b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319784/)**: Wizards can conjure large magical bubbles that float above the ground, serving as mobile shelters and transportation vessels. Players can ride inside these bubbles, floating effortlessly across the landscape and exploring hard-to-reach places. The wizard bubble provides protection from environmental hazards and allows players to rest and recharge during their travels.

4. **[Walking<sup>5b</sup>]([https:/](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312892/)/)**: For shorter distances or when exploring confined spaces like magical forests or hidden caves, walking remains a reliable method of transportation. It allows players to immerse themselves fully in the magical world, discovering hidden treasures and interacting with NPCs along the way.

#### [From Main Moodboard](https://www.pinterest.com/serapath/wizard-page-next/?invite_code=fff7da246acd46bdaa7f309a11411504&sender=910642124561769093): 
 - 1a. [Magical Portals](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352235016/): A portal that connects two different dimension (in our case connecting our different projects)
 - 2a. [different regions and dimensions](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352236328/): might be not best representation but if we create portal in our one website we might need to create one in our other projects as well like there should be a portal in playproject.io as well so they could travel from there to wizard amigos as well.


#### [From Inspiration Moodboard](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/serapath/finalwiz/)
- 1b. [Broomsticks](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312828/): This could one form of transportation but if we are going toward more cyberpunk and futuristic style this will not match well.
- 2b. [realm ring](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/844493673168126/): we didn't had realm ring in our moodboards we might need to add some. (this was the random one I found in pinterest)
- 3b. [portals](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352378616/): Another representation of how portal might look like.
- 4b. [Wizard Bubble](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352319784/): Instead of broomstick we could go with this more modern style of bubble transportation.
- 5b. [Walking]([https:/](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352312892/)/): if we going with first person view walking might not be the best suitable means of transport.

### Gear and Equipment:


1. **[Wizard Magic Stall<sup>1b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333882/)**: The wizard magic stall serves as a clubhouse where wizards store and exchange gear and equipment. Players can visit the stall to pick up essential items for their journey or exchange items they no longer need. Since wizards live a nomadic lifestyle with limited carrying capacity, they must choose wisely which items to take with them.

2. **[Omni Bag<sup>2b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/14003448832332870/)**: Each player starts with an omni bag, a magical backpack with limited storage capacity. The omni bag serves as the player's inventory, holding essential items such as the realm ring, potions, and magical artifacts. Players must manage their inventory carefully, prioritizing items based on their quest objectives and current needs.

3. **[Item Exchange System<sup>3b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333837/)**: Wizards can exchange items with each other through the item exchange system. Players can offer items they no longer need in exchange for items they require for their journey. This fosters a sense of community and collaboration among players, as they help each other by sharing resources and equipment.

4. **Limited Capacity**: Since wizards cannot carry everything with them due to their [nomadic lifestyle<sup>1a</sup>](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539798705352232603/), they must prioritize essential items and leave behind non-essential gear. This encourages players to make strategic decisions about which items to take on their quests and adventures.

5. **[Exploration and Discovery<sup>4b</sup>](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333887/)**: As players explore the magical realm, they may discover hidden caches of gear and equipment scattered throughout the landscape. These hidden treasures offer valuable resources and rewards to those who find them, incentivizing exploration and discovery in the game. like Easter eggs.

- 2b. [Omni Bag](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/14003448832332870/): Also we don't have any omni bags inspirations in our moodboard we might need to look for some.
- 3b. [Item Exchange System](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333837/): players could virtually through modern vr style hologram window they could exchange item with eachother.
- 4b. [Exploration and Discovery](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/539798705352333887/): we might have to look for some modern futuristic style easter eggs or treasure box if we are going to include this part.
